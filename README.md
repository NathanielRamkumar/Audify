# Audify

Welcome to Audify!

This is an app that will convert PDF files to usable audiobooks. The goal of this app is to make digital books more accessible for people with dylexia by converting them into a digital format. The audio is stored locally so it's easier to export to different locations. 

The app is still in the alpha stages of development, and there will be more features to come

Features to Expect:
1. Installation Intructions
2. Graphical User Interface
3. Compiled Build
4. PDF scanning by page
